# ApertusVR
Distributed scene sharing engine for virtual and augmented reality on any platform



## About
ApertusVR has a loosely coupled structure in order to easily configure the
engine capabilities and run these configuration instances on different machines
and connect them together via internet. 

ApertusVR creates multiuser scenes which means that all of the participant shares
the same things at the same time.

ApertusVR has set-in-stone interfaces, language bindings and disjunct libraries therefore
it is easily embeddable to an existing development.
